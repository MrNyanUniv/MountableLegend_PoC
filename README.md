# Proof of Concept Shoulder-Mountable Legendary in Cobblemon!

![BSL96w8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b753fbfb-ae58-4d9a-99c0-1dee64314b87)

This is a resource/data pack that includes an example of how to make a legendary pokemon shoulder-mountable without altering the original pokemon. This relies on using the species_additions file system that adds to a target species file instead of replacing the full file within cobblemon.

## Pack Features include:
- Slight Animation Inclusion ( Left-Shoulder, Right-Shoulder)
- New feature keyword: legend_mount
- Both the original Darkrai and a mini Darkrai that still works perfectly for battles!
- New Shoulder Pokemon: Darkrai!

This resource/data pack is only a proof-of-concept and should not be used unless to reference for own data pack or to test on your own world!
